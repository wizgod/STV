/****************************************************************************************/ 
/**
 This class functions as a means to simplify development with SCTableViewModel.
 
 SCViewController conveniently provides several ready made navigation
 bar types based on SCNavigationBarType, provided that it is a subview of a navigation controller. 
 'SCViewController' also defines placeholders for a tableView and a tableViewModel that
 the user can allocate and assign. If a tableViewModel is defined, SCViewController also
 connects its doneButton (if present) to tableViewModel's commitButton automatically.
 
 In addition, SCViewController fully manages memory warnings and makes sure the assigned table view is released once a memory warning occurs and reloaded once the view controller is loaded once more.
 
 Finally, SCViewController provides several useful actions (SCViewControllerActions) and delegate methods (SCViewControllerDelegate) that notify the delegate object of events like the view appearing or disappearing.
 
 @note You do NOT have to use 'SCViewController' in order to be able to use SCTableViewModel, but it's highly recommended that you do so whenever you need a UIViewController.
